Summary on what I learnt soo far about OOP

Due to the importance of this topic I want to summarize what I learnt:

1- prototype is like a blueprint which we can create new objects ;

2- the 4 principle of OOP :

     Abstraction : which is basically hiding the details that doesn't matter or otherwise we will get frustrated with the amount of info we need to keep track of .

    Encapsulation: keeping some properties or method private inside the class so they are not accessible from outside ; think of your Lock cash that you hide in your room why not leaving it in garden . same principle goes here .

    Inheritance : making all properties and methods of a class available to a child class . now look to your small legs who do you think you inherited them from ? same goes here ;

    Polymorphism : a child class can overwrite a method it inherited from a parent class . yes you can grow them legs ;)

3- 3 ways of implementing prototypal inheritance in JS :

-constructor function.

-Es6 class .

-object.create().

4- prototype of a constructor function is the same as the prototype of the object we created from the constructor objects (this seemed to me logic because of the prototype chain am I mistaken?)
